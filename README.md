# cents
A small and simple rust program that I decided to make for learning (this is extended from the coins example in the rust book)
## Usage
From the command line this program can be used like
```bash
cents penny
```
This will echo the amount of cents that a penny is worth <br >
Arguments
```bash
# -c == --count which specifies the amount of the coin we should convert.
cents -c 20 penny
```
Will return 20 pennys are 20 cents!
